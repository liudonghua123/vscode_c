# vscode_c

This is a template vscode c project for windows platform.

### How to use

1. git clone https://github.com/liudonghua123/vscode_c.git
2. open in vscode (`code vscode_c`)
3. write your program
4. press F5 to debug (the executable is generated under `bin` directory)
5. (optional) edit `.vscode/launch.json`/`.vscode/tasks.json` to make some custumization.

### Prerequisites

Because the template project use `MSYS2` and `gcc`, so you need to install first. Then configure `C:\msys32\mingw32\bin` and `C:\msys32\usr\bin` to your PATH environment variable.
